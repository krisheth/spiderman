		<strong>Created by: Krish Sheth</strong>
		
		<h2>Brief Overview</h2>
		Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962. 
		He first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 and has since had appeared in thousands
		of comic book issues and is one of the most well recognized superheros. Hollywood has
		been able to capitalize on his popularity and since 2002, there have been 7 feature
		films and three film series. The original Sam Raini trilogy (the best in my opinion)
		was able to renew the interest of Spider-Man in older people and introduced the hero
		to a whole new generation of kids paving the way for future Spider-Man movies. Below 
		are pictures of the film posters for <em>Spider-Man (2002)</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2 (2004)</em>
		&amp; <em>Spider-Man 3 (2007)</em>, respectively:

		<h2>Storyline</h2>
			<h3>Spider-Man (2002)</h3>
			Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker who is a nerdy high-schooler. He was
			orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson.
			To say his life is "miserable" is an understatement. But one day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive
		    spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires a muscle-bound physique,
		    clear vision, ability to cling to surfaces and crawl over walls, shooting webs from his wrist ... but the fun isn't going
	        to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter
			ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will
			kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end.
			<h3>Spider-Man 2 (2004)</h3>
			Peter Parker is an unhappy man: after two years of fighting crime as Spider-Man, his life has begun to fall apart.
			The girl he loves is engaged to someone else, his grades are slipping, he cannot keep any of his jobs, and on top
			of it, the newspaper Daily Bugle is attacking him viciously, claiming that Spider-Man is a criminal. He reaches the
			breaking point and gives up the crime fighter's life, once and for all. But after a failed fusion experiment, eccentric
		    and obsessive scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into super villain Doctor Octopus, Doc Ock for short, having four
			long tentacles as extra hands. Peter guesses it might just be time for Spider-Man to return, but would he act upon it?
			<h3>Spider-Man 3 (2007)</h3>
			Peter Parker has finally managed to piece together the once-broken parts of his life,
			maintaining a balance between his relationship with Mary-Jane and his responsibility as Spider-Man.
			But more challenges arise for our young hero. Peter's old friend Harry Obsourne has set out for revenge
			against Peter; taking up the mantle of his late father's persona as The New Goblin, and Peter must also
		    capture Uncle Ben's real killer, Flint Marko, who has been transformed into his toughest foe yet, the Sandman.
	        All hope seems lost when suddenly Peter's suit turns jet-black and greatly amplifies his powers. But it also
			begins to greatly amplify the much darker qualities of Peter's personality that he begins to lose himself to.
			Peter has to reach deep inside himself to free the compassionate hero he used to be if he is to ever conquer
			the darkness within and face not only his greatest enemies, but also...himself.
